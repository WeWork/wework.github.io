When beginning a new software development endeavor, there is no shortage of information available on processes and procedures to ensure success. I can tell you right here and now in front of God and Tom Cruise that most of these will lead to failure, hardship and eventually suicide. If you’re looking for the capital T truth in software engineering processes follow these 5 easy rules and you’ll be well on your way to creating the next “uber-for-prostitutes”.

**One.** _You don’t need an in-house engineering team._<br>
Whiny. Overpaid. Insubordinate and churlish. These three words describe your typical, good-for-nothing software engineer. If you don’t want to spend all your time arguing over things like “quality user experience” and “maintainability” go ahead and save yourself a huge headache and find an overseas development firm, you’ll always pay less and you’ll end up with exactly the product you ask for. Even better, consider using unpaid interns and students from technical programs. It’s a fact, all programming knowledge is gained from googling things then copying and pasting. Remember, if your developer has spent more than 6 weeks honing their craft, they obviously don’t know how to prioritize. One geek is just as good as another.

**Two.** _Start with a well-defined, long term plan_<br>
Ensuring success is all about taking your time. Really think through your product. If you don’t exactly know you’re going to process credit cards from Australia or whether or not you’re going to offer coupon codes, you better figure it out, buddy! I can’t tell you how many projects I’ve worked on where everything was going along perfectly for the first 60 days, great user feedback, amazing profitability only to be DERAILED COMPLETELY by the fact that we did not account for something as simple as daylight savings times in reservations in Isreal. Boy was my face red and the investors pulled the plug! Don’t end up like this. Write a plan. Include detailed specs. The more the better. Remember it's your vision.

**Three.** _Design. Brand. Enough Said._<br>
Why do you think Steve Jobs was so successful? He cared more about design and branding than anything else, that's why. That's the only thing separating the good products from the bad ones. Just like with a long-term plan. You really want to think every piece of design through. Make beautiful comps. Decide on animations early and often. Remember your users really only care about one thing: how your product feels. Breaking conventions is a great way to make your product feel unique. If you don’t think the logo should go in the top left and take you to the homepage, don’t put it there. The more you think about a design, the more beautiful and simple it will be.

**Four.** _The Logo_<br>
Everyone knows, great ideas and products have great logos. This is really a no-brainer.

**Five.** _Be persistent._<br>
If an idea is not working. That’s OK, it just needs more time. Consider redesigning the experience. You would be amazed what a simple change in button color, or typeface can accomplish.
