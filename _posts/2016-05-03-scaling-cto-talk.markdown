As VP Engineering at WeWork, I had a great time attending the [Wheelhouse CTO Summit held at the NASDAQ](http://summits.wheelhouse.io/newyork/index.html) a few months ago.

There were a lot of great talks by some of NY's top engineering leaders. Here's mine:

Some of the topics I cover:

* Companies at different stages need different skills from successful engineering leaders. (2:30)
* As my company grows, I'll transition from managing technology to managing people. What does that mean? (starting at 3:40)
* What's the difference between speed and agility, and why are we moving so slowly? (8:45)
* What is Conway's law, and how can I use it to my advantage? (12:02)
* What can architectural patterns teach me about product teams' organizational structures? (12:37)

I would love to hear your feedback in the comments.
