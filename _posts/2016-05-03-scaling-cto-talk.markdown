### The Scaling CTO Talk at the Wheelhouse CTO Summit at the NASDAQ

I had a great time attending the [Wheelhouse CTO Summit held at the NASDAQ](http://summits.wheelhouse.io/newyork/index.html) a few months ago.

There were a lot of really great talks by some of the top engineering leaders in NY. Here's one by yours truly:

Some of the topics I cover:

* Companies at different stages require different skills from successful engineering leaders. (2:30)
* Everyone knows that as the company grows you're expected to make the shift from a technical manager to a people's manager, but what does it mean? (starting at 3:40)
* What's the difference between speed and agility and why are we moving so slowly? (8:45)
* What is Conway's law and how can you use it to your advantage? (12:02)
* What can architectural patterns teach us about product teams and organizational structures? (12:37)

Would love to hear your feedback in the comments.
